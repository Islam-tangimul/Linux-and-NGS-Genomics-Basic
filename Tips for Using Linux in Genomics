#Get Comfortable with the Command Line
Start every session by running pwd to know where you are.
Use TAB to auto-complete file and folder names — it saves time and avoids typos.
Use the up arrow (↑) to repeat previous commands.

#Practice with Real Genomic Data
Download small FASTA/FASTQ files from NCBI or Ensembl.
Use head, less, and wc -l to inspect and analyze file structure.

# Stay Organized
Create structured directories for projects:
project/, data/, results/, scripts/
Avoid working directly in system directories or ~/.

# Understand File Extensions
.fa or .fasta: DNA/protein sequences
.fq or .fastq: Sequencing reads (contains quality scores)
.bam, .sam: Aligned reads
.vcf: Variant call format
 Use file filename to check what kind of file it really is.

# Be Careful with Large Files
Don’t use cat on files >100MB — use less or head.
Redirect long output using > or >>:
ls -l > file_list.txt

# Keep a Command Log
Save useful commands in a text file: notes.txt
Helps with reproducibility and writing analysis scripts later.

# Use man and --help
Use man ls or ls --help to learn what options are available for each command.
