# Linux-and-NGS-Genomics-Basic
Linux/Unix systems are heavily used in bioinformatics due to their powerful shell capabilities, command-line tools, and efficient data handling.
Most bioinformatics tools are developed for Linux, particularly those used in servers and high-performance computing environments.

# Linux and NGS Genomics
This repository contains tools, scripts, and workflows for analyzing genomic data using Linux-based environments. It focuses on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and includes practical examples for common bioinformatics tasks.

# Features
Linux command-line tools for genomic data handling
NGS pipeline components (e.g., quality control, alignment, variant calling)
Bash scripts and utility functions
Guidelines for setting up a bioinformatics environment on Linux
Sample datasets and usage examples

# Topics Covered
FASTQ preprocessing (e.g., Trimmomatic, FastQC)
Read alignment (e.g., BWA, Bowtie2)
Variant calling (e.g., SAMtools, GATK)
File format manipulation (e.g., FASTQ, SAM/BAM, VCF)
Shell scripting for pipeline automation
